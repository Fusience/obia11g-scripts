# This is a response file for the Fusion Middleware Patch Set Assistant.
# Individual component upgrades are performed in the order they are described here.
# Each upgrade is introduced by a section header containing the name of the
# component and name of the upgrade plugin. The form of the section header is
# [ComponentName.PluginName]
# These names can be found in the Upgrade Descriptor files for the components.

# Individual input lines consist of a name, an equal sign, and a value.
# The name is in two parts separated by a period.  The first part is the 'name'
# attribute from the Descriptor File XML tag by which the plugin refers to the value.
# The second part of the name identifies a field within that value.  Some input
# types have only one field, while other types can have half a dozen.   Do not
# intermix input lines that apply to different XML tags.
